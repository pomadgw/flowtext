# FlowText

This is a free web application inspired by [Flowstate](http://www.hailoverman.com/flowstate)
and [The Most Dangerous Writing App](http://www.themostdangerouswritingapp.com/).
This app force you to be creative on writing by non-stop typing.

## What if I stop typing?
If you stop typing for five seconds, say goodbye to your writing!!

## What if I manage to type until time limit?
The text will be saved into your browser's local storage,
so you can open it again later (but you can not edit it).

# Behind this app

This app (and two apps mentioned above) utilize what psychologists term
**flow**, or **the zone**, which is the mental state of operation in
which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of
energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the
activity. In essence, flow is characterized by complete absorption in
what one does. (Thanks, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29))
